# sql-challenge

Sources
 - For this challenge, I mainly relied on in-class examples from Module 9.
 - I used [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56102027/how-to-select-year-using-a-where-clause-on-a-datetime-type-column) Stack Overflow question for more information on the "Date" format in the employees table.
 - I also contacted AskBCS for help with an error code, and they explained the concept of composite keys and assisted with importing the CSVs.
